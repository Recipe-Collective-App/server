      cookingTime: "1 hour 7 minutes (Prep 7 minutes, Cook 1 hour)",
      ingredients: [
        "2 red onions",
        "3 mixed-colour peppers",
        "4 chicken legs, skin on, bone-in",
        "1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning",
        "4 cloves of garlic",
        "olive oil",
        "red wine vinegar",
        "1 mug of basmati rice (300g)",
        "4 tablespoons natural yoghurt",
        "optional: extra virgin olive oil",
      ],
      instructions:
        "Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Peel and halve the onions. Tear up the peppers into big chunks, discarding the seeds and stalks. Place it all in a 25cm x 35cm roasting tray with the chicken, Cajun seasoning and whole unpeeled garlic cloves. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon each of olive oil and red wine vinegar, season with black pepper and toss well, turning the chicken skin side up. Roast for 40 minutes. Boil the kettle. Remove the tray from the oven and mash the soft garlic cloves into the tray juices, discarding the skins. Around the chicken, pour in 1 mug of rice and 2 mugs of boiling kettle water. Carefully cover with tin foil and return to the oven for 20 minutes, or until the rice is fluffy and the chicken pulls easily away from the bone. Season to perfection, then serve with dollops of yoghurt, a pinch of black pepper, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, if you like.",

      recipeName: "Smashed lemongrass chicken",

      source:
        "https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/chicken-recipes/smashed-lemongrass-chicken/",
      cookingTime: "18 minutes",
      ingredients: [
        "2 cloves of garlic",
        "6 cm piece of ginger",
        "2 sticks of lemongrass",
        "2 x 150 g skinless chicken breasts",
        "olive oil",
        "2 nests of vermicelli rice noodles",
        "1 x 320 g packet of mixed stir-fry veg",
        "teriyaki sauce",
        "optional: extra virgin olive oil",
        "2 limes",
      ],
      instructions:
        "Boil the kettle. Peel and matchstick the garlic and ginger. Whack the lemongrass against your work surface, remove the tough outer layer, then finely slice. Lay out a large sheet of greaseproof paper. Place the chicken breasts on one half, then stab a few times with the knife – this will help the flavour to penetrate. Sprinkle with a small pinch of sea salt and black pepper, the garlic, ginger and lemongrass, and drizzle with a little olive oil. Fold the paper over and bash with a rolling pin to flatten to 1.5cm thick. In a bowl, cover the noodles with boiling kettle water. Put a 30cm non-stick frying pan on a high heat and, once hot, place the chicken in the pan, lemongrass side down. Cook for 3 minutes on each side, or until golden and cooked through. When you turn it, tip in the mixed veg alongside to cook through. Drain the noodles and divide between your plates. Move the chicken to a board. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of teriyaki over each plate of noodles and the chicken, also drizzling with a little extra virgin olive oil, if you like. Toss 1 tablespoon of teriyaki and the juice of 1 lime with the veg in the pan for a final 30 seconds, then pile over the noodles. Serve with lime wedges, for squeezing over.",
